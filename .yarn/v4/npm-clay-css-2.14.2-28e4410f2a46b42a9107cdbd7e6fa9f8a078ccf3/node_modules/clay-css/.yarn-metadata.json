It is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) as a foundation.\n\nYou can view the various components on [the Clay site](http://clayui.com).\n\n<!-- TODO: provide link to Lexicon site for documentation on design patterns -->\n\n## Building\nIf you would like to contribute, or make changes on your system you need to do the following:\n\n### Clone the repo\nClone the repo to your computer\n\n### Install Node.js (v4.6.0 LTS) and NPM\nIf you don't already have it installed. You can find more info here: http://nodejs.org/\nNode and NPM come bundled together, so you only need to install one package.\n\n### Install the NPM modules\nRun `npm install` inside of the `packages/clay-css` directory\n\n### Modify files in src/\nThe files are generated from the `src/` directory, however, most of the files you'd be interested in changing are in `src/content/`. Files can be either HTML (`.html`) or Markdown (`.md`).\nEvery file in `src/content/` has a heading at the top in YAML format that looks something like:\n\n\n    ---\n    title: Title of the Page\n    ---\n\nThis section has a couple of options that can be leveraged for different purposes. Those will be covered below.\n\n### Build the static files\nRun `gulp build` to generate the static files.\n\n### View the files\nThe generated files are placed into the `build/` directory.\nSass files in the `.scss` format are generated to CSS, Markdown files with the extension of `.md` are generated to HTML, and HTML files have one bit of processing applied, which is that HTML inside of triple ticks is escaped, like so:\n\n    ```\n\t<div>Foo</div>\n    ```\n\n### File Heading Options\nThere are a couple of properties you can add to the headings of files, only one of which is required:\n\n`title:`: **(Required)** This is used for the title of the page in the heading and in the navigation sidebar\n\n`navIndex:`:  The navigation is sorted alphabetically by default, but if you pass a `navIndex:` property, it will manually sort the item into that position.\nThe property is any number, with `0` as the first position, but you can also pass in a keyword of `last` to force an item to the end.\n\n`section:`: If you want to group multiple files into sections, in each of those files, pass the same title to the `section:` property. That title will be used for the section heading, and the files will be sorted in there. The `navIndex:` property works inside of sections as well.\n\n### Available Build Tasks\nYou can pass these options when running `gulp`.\n\n`build`: This is the default task, so running just `gulp` will fire off the build task.\nThis will generate all of the HTML/CSS/etc into the `build/` directory.\n\n`watch`: Because running a script after every change can get tedious, run `gulp watch` to rebuild the files automatically as you change files.\n\n`serve`: Starts a local server on port 3000 and also runs the watch task.\n"
