Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\n\nInstallation and Usage\n----------------------\n\nJSDoc supports Node.js 4.2.0 and later. You can install JSDoc globally or in your project's\n`node_modules` folder.\n\nTo install the latest version on npm globally (may require `sudo`; [learn how to fix\nthis](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)):\n\n    npm install -g jsdoc\n\nTo install the latest version on npm locally and save it in your package's `package.json` file:\n\n    npm install --save-dev jsdoc\n\n**Note**: By default, npm adds your package using the caret operator in front of the version number\n(for example, `^3.5.2`). We recommend using the tilde operator instead (for example, `~3.5.2`),\nwhich limits updates to the most recent patch-level version. See [this Stack Overflow\nanswer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22343224) for more information about the caret and tilde\noperators.\n\nTo install the latest development version locally, without updating your project's `package.json`\nfile:\n\n    npm install git+https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git\n\nIf you installed JSDoc locally, the JSDoc command-line tool is available in `./node_modules/.bin`.\nTo generate documentation for the file `yourJavaScriptFile.js`:\n\n    ./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js\n\nOr if you installed JSDoc globally, simply run the `jsdoc` command:\n\n    jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js\n\nBy default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named `out`. You can use the\n`--destination` (`-d`) option to specify another directory.\n\nRun `jsdoc --help` for a complete list of command-line options.\n\nTemplates and Tools\n-------------------\n\nThe JSDoc community has created numerous templates and other tools to help you generate and\ncustomize your documentation. Here are just a few:\n\n### Templates\n\n+ [jaguarjs-jsdoc](https://github.com/davidshimjs/jaguarjs-jsdoc)\n+ [DocStrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap) ([example](https://docstrap.github.io/docstrap))\n+ [jsdoc3Template](https://github.com/DBCDK/jsdoc3Template)\n  ([example](https://github.com/danyg/jsdoc3Template/wiki#wiki-screenshots))\n+ [minami](https://github.com/Nijikokun/minami)\n+ [docdash](https://github.com/clenemt/docdash) ([example](http://clenemt.github.io/docdash/))\n+ [tui-jsdoc-template](https://github.com/nhnent/tui.jsdoc-template) ([example](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.jsdoc-template/latest/))\n\n### Build Tools\n\n+ [JSDoc Grunt plugin](https://github.com/krampstudio/grunt-jsdoc)\n+ [JSDoc Gulp plugin](https://github.com/mlucool/gulp-jsdoc3)\n\n### Other Tools\n\n+ [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown)\n+ [Integrating GitBook with\nJSDoc](https://medium.com/@kevinast/integrate-gitbook-jsdoc-974be8df6fb3)\n\nFor More Information\n--------------------\n\n+ Documentation is available at [Use JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org).\n+ Contribute to the docs at [jsdoc3/jsdoc3.github.com](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc3.github.com).\n+ [Join JSDoc's Slack channel](https://jsdoc-slack.appspot.com/).\n+ Ask for help on the [JSDoc Users mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jsdoc-users).\n+ Post questions tagged `jsdoc` to [Stack\nOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jsdoc).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nJSDoc 3 is copyright (c) 2011-present Michael Mathews <micmath@gmail.com> and the [contributors to\nJSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/graphs/contributors).\n\nJSDoc 3 is free software, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
