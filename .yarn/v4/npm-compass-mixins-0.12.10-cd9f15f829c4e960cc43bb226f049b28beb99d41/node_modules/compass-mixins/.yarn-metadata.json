This project makes minimal modifications to the original stylesheets from the [original repository](https://github.com/Compass/compass/tree/stable/core/stylesheets), intented to improve libsass compatibility and not change output.\n\n## Compass Ruby Functions\n\nThis project includes reasonably similar implementations of some of the Ruby functions that Compass provides as Sass extensions. These are used in some Compass mixins, such as `@include background()`.\n\nTo make those functions available to your compass mixins, you'll want to either `@import \"compass\";` or `@import \"compass/functions\"'` before the specific compass scss files you import.\n\n## Contributors\nGuillaume Balaine Igosuki@github\nMichael Heillein michaek@github\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2008-2009 Christopher M.
