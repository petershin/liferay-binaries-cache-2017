    "readme": "istanbul-lib-instrument\n-----------------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/istanbuljs/istanbul-lib-instrument.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/istanbuljs/istanbul-lib-instrument)\n\nIstanbul instrumenter library.\n\nVersion 1.1.x now implements instrumentation using `Babel`. The implementation is inspired\nby prior art by @dtinth as demonstrated in the `__coverage__` babel plugin.\n\nIt provides 2 \"modes\" of instrumentation.\n\n* The old API that is mostly unchanged (except for incompatibilities noted) and\n  performs the instrumentation using babel as a library.\n\n* A `programVisitor` function for the Babel AST that can be used by a Babel plugin\n  to emit instrumentation for ES6 code directly without any source map\n  processing. This is the preferred path for babel users. The Babel plugin is\n  called `babel-plugin-istanbul`.\n\nIncompatibilities and changes to instrumentation behavior can be found in\n[v0-changes.md](v0-changes.md).\n\n\n",
