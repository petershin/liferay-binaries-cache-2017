Returns a merged stream.\n\n#### `merged.add`\n\nA method to dynamically add more sources to the stream. The argument supplied to `add` can be either a source or an array of sources.\n\n#### `merged.isEmpty`\n\nA method that tells you if the merged stream is empty.\n\nWhen a stream is \"empty\" (aka. no sources were added), it could not be returned to a gulp task.\n\nSo, we could do something like this:\n\n```js\nstream = require('merge-stream')();\n// Something like a loop to add some streams to the merge stream\n// stream.add(streamA);\n// stream.add(streamB);\nreturn stream.isEmpty() ? null : stream;\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
