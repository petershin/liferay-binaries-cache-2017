    "readme": "# browser-process-hrtime\n\nBrowser shim for Node.js process.hrtime().\nSee [documentation at nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_hrtime)\n\n### usage\nUse hrtime independant of environment (node or browser).\nIt will use process.hrtime first and fallback if not present.\n```js\nvar hrtime = require('browser-process-hrtime')\nvar start = hrtime()\n// ...\nvar delta = hrtime(start)\n```\n\n### monkey-patching\nYou can monkey-patch process.hrtime for your dependency graph like this:\n```js\nprocess.hrtime = require('browser-process-hrtime')\nvar coolTool = require('module-that-uses-hrtime-somewhere-in-its-depths')\n```\n\n### note\nThis was originally pull-requested against [node-process](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-process),\nbut they are trying to stay lean.\n",
