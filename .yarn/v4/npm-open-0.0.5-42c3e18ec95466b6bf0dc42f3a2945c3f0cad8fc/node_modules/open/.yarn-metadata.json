    "readme": "# open\n\nOpen a file or url in the user's preferred application.\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar open = require(\"open\");\nopen(\"http://www.google.com\");\n```\n\n`open` taks an optional argument specifying the program to be used to open the\nfile or URL.\n\n```javascript\nopen(\"http://www.google.com\", \"firefox\");\n```\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install open\n\n# How it works\n\n- on `win32` uses `start`\n- on `darwin` uses `open`\n- otherwise uses the `xdg-open` script from [freedesktop.org](http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html)\n\n# Warning\n\nThe same care should be taken when calling open as if you were calling\n[child_process.exec](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback)\ndirectly. If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.\n",
